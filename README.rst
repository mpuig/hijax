========
Hijax demo, Django 1.5 
========

Initial Remark
==============
This just updates the example found at https://github.com/mpuig/hijax to be useable with Django 1.5.

Documentation
=============

I found this posts: Based on the example found at http://duganchen.ca/single-page-web-app-architecture-done-right and I decided to test it.

The result is a proof of concept of some popular web technologies:

* Django, my favorite framework. 
* Hijax (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijax). 
* Mustache templates (via mustache.js)
* backbone.js & underscore.js.

Test It
=======

run it: ./manage.py runserver
browse: http://localhost:8000

Requirements 
============

Django 1.5
